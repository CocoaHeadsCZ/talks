# Setting it up 🚀

# USE-CASES

- DEBUG 🔍
- DECOUPLE FROM BACKEND 💔
- SIMULATE ERRORS 💣
- OPEN-UP SSL 🔓

---
# Debug
## 🔍

^ 
1. When you want to ensure sending and receiving proper data (headers, body, length etc.)
2. Performance measures (compression)
3. [Breakpoints](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/proxying/breakpoints/) (modify requests on-fly -> change text length to test UI)

---

# Decouple from backend
## 💔

^ 
1. Map local (working offline)
2. "when BE API is not ready/deployed yet" use-case

---

# Simulate errors
## 💣

^ 
1. Rewrite - enables you to create rules that modify requests and responses as they pass through Charles. Rules such as adding or changing a header or search and replace some text in the response body

--- 

# Open-up SSL 🔓

^
- Easy to observe traffic ON DEVICE
- Uses ["packet tunnel"](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension/nepackettunnelprovider) [network extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/networkextension) to create what looks like VPN locally (VPN logo in upper-right corner), but runs all traffic through Charles locally
- CELLULAR trafic

# Alternatives
